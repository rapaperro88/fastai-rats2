# Background

Increasing biodiversity decreases the risk of having one species overwhelming others. This is one of the cornerstones of permaculture-related practises. Identifying a specie and its behaviour is central in order to respect biodiversity and revert out-of-control proliferation of some species. It is interesting to identify different species of rodents, more specifically rats, to eliminate the fears and preconceived ideas about this animals...

# Goal

The object of this project will be to train a Convolutional Neural Network, CNN, to identify images of three different "rat" species. And to deploy an infering application to the public use.
